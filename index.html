                            Dr. Caroline Farrior's lab, building a mathematical model
                            of Janzen-Connell dynamics. I also did a summer of research for
                            Dr. Daniel Spalink at Texas A&M University, where I began the creation
                            of an R package to pull and clean data from the

                                McCreedy in the Texas A&M Biology Department. I have developed
                                a workflow to analyze neutrohpils in publicly avalable single-cell
                                RNA-seq data. This work will result in a first-author publication.

                            <p>While at UT Austin, I developed a mathematical
                                model under Dr. Caroline Farrior. This model
                                simulated how specialist naturalist enemies combat
                                ecological drift. Namely, we examined how the levels
                                of enemy specialization necessary to combat drift
                                in communities of varying sizes.

                                Texas A&M Herbarium. I began the development of a new R package
                                known as "curatoR". The purpose of this package is to provide
                                easy methods for scientists to pull and clean data from the
                                Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF).
